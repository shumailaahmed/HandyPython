I dont always like to upload my pdf to online platforms due to my privacy concerns.

Furhter the limits they have bother me a little too much

Here is a handy python script for merging multiple pdf into one big fat pdf :) 

Using PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files into one in Python. 

Code combines all PDF files in the current directory

This code uses the PyPDF2.PdfFileMerger class to combine all PDFs in the pdf_list and writes the output to the file specified by output. The merge_pdfs function can be customized to merge specific PDFs in a specific order
